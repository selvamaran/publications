                     <b>Slowly activating current can restore bursting for long-lasting somatic, but not dendritic, depolarization. (A</b>) A long, strong (50 nS for 9 seconds) square conductance pulse applied at the soma initially elicits tonic spiking that eventually
                     switches to bursting. Bursting is reestablished for inputs given at soma in both the biological (A1) and model (A2) neuron.

                     and calcium concentration (A4). The original limit cycle is shown in green, and the new one in solid blue. The transient after
                     pulse onset is shown in dotted blue and the transient after pulse offset is shown in red. In the absence of very slow potassium

                     strong (20 nS for 9 seconds) pulse applied directly to the dendrite in the model with very slow potassium current causes cessation
                     of spiking. The colors and curves in model neuron voltage trace and phase plane analysis correspond to those in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig3">3</a>. (GIF 73 kb)
